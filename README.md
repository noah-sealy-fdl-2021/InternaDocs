# internadocs, a side project by Noah Sealy
### Web app for tracking and managing internal documentation.
### react + bootstrap --> rest --> django + SQLite :)
### To run the front end, use the command "npm start" on a Unix terminal from the root folder.
### To run the back end, use the command "python manage.py runserver" on a Unix terminal from the root folder. Since the project is still only being run locally, you will need to populate the database with some data corresponding to the models.
